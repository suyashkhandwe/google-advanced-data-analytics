> Data science and data analytics are distinct but connected fields that have developed over time in the evolving data career space. Organizations often use these terms interchangeably when hiring, so being able to recognize the similarities and differences between the two professions will help you identify opportunities that are aligned with your particular skill set. Thatâ€™s why, throughout this course, you will learn more about the data career space as a whole and how data analytics professionals work within that space.

- Read about Jupyter Notebooks
- Data science is a field of study that uses raw data to create new ways of modeling and understanding the unknown. To learn about data science, enroll in the Google Data Analytics Certificate.
- A ***SMART* **question that promotes change is action-oriented. To learn about SMART questions, enroll in the Google Data Analytics Certificate.

  - Read about `SMART`.
- ***Leading questions*** include:

  * How satisfied were you with our customer representative?
  * In what ways did our product meet your needs?
  * And what do you enjoy most about our service?

> [!NOTE]
> Leading questions direct the respondent to a particular answer, often because they suggest the answer within the question.

- ***Metrics*** are quantifiable data types used for measurement and performance evaluation.
- There are ***three main benefits of using a programming language to work with data***: Easily reproduce and share work, save time, and clarify the steps of analysis.
- It is more effective to ***label a data visualization instead of using a legend*** for several reasons:

  - Labels can be placed near the data.
  - They make the data visualization more accessible.
  - They allow for text explanations to be placed directly on the visualization
- ***Filters* **can be used to -

  - highlight individual data points
  - limit the number of rows or columns in view
